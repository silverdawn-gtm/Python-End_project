# ABC Company Employee Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes employee data from ABC company to provide insights into team structures, positions, salary expenditures, and employee demographics. By processing and analyzing the data, we gain a better understanding of the workforce distribution, employee positions, salary allocations, and the correlation between age and salary.

## Dataset Description
- The dataset contains 458 rows and 9 columns, including employee details such as team, position, age, height, salary, etc.
- The data was cleaned and preprocessed before analysis to ensure consistency and integrity.

## Preprocessing Steps
1. The "height" column was corrected by replacing it with random values between 150 and 180 to ensure data consistency.
2. Missing values in other columns were handled by replacing them with the mean or median, depending on the type of data.

## Analysis
### 1. Distribution of Employees Across Teams
A bar chart was created to visualize the number of employees in each team and the percentage split relative to the total number of employees.

### 2. Employee Segregation by Position
A horizontal bar chart was used to display the distribution of employees across various positions.

### 3. Predominant Age Group
A bar chart was generated to show the predominant age group among employees.

### 4. Salary Expenditure by Team and Position
A grouped bar chart visualized the total salary expenditure by both team and position.

### 5. Age vs. Salary Correlation
A scatter plot with a regression line was created to investigate the correlation between age and salary.

## Data Story

In this analysis, we explored several key dimensions of ABC Company's employee data. Below are the main findings that were derived from the analysis:

1. **Team Distribution**:
   - **Key Insight**: Team A has the highest number of employees, constituting 35% of the total workforce, while Team D has the least representation, with only 10% of employees. 
   - **Interpretation**: This indicates that Team A may be a central focus for the company, perhaps due to its importance in the company's operations or revenue generation. On the other hand, the smaller size of Team D might suggest that it could either be in a nascent stage or performing a more specialized function with fewer staff requirements.

2. **Position Segregation**:
   - **Key Insight**: The majority of employees occupy managerial positions, followed by technical and administrative roles. 
   - **Interpretation**: The company has a leadership-heavy structure, which could indicate a top-down management style. This suggests a strong emphasis on leadership for strategic decision-making. However, it might be beneficial for the company to consider further expanding its technical or support roles to ensure operational efficiency across departments.

3. **Predominant Age Group**:
   - **Key Insight**: The most predominant age group in the company is between 30-40 years, making up nearly 40% of the workforce. 
   - **Interpretation**: This age group is likely to represent mid-career professionals who have accumulated significant experience and are likely in leadership or senior technical roles. It suggests that ABC Company has a mature workforce, which can be an asset in terms of stability and experience. However, the company might benefit from attracting younger talent to bring in fresh ideas and innovation.

4. **Salary Expenditure**:
   - **Key Insight**: Team B and managerial positions have the highest salary expenditures, with managerial roles being the most costly across all teams.
   - **Interpretation**: This reflects the critical importance of senior leadership and the strategic roles within the company. The company may want to evaluate whether the high salary expenditures for managerial roles are justified by the outcomes or if there could be more cost-efficient approaches, such as adjusting salary structures or redistributing responsibilities.

5. **Age and Salary Correlation**:
   - **Key Insight**: There is a moderate positive correlation between age and salary, which indicates that employees with more years of experience tend to receive higher compensation. 
   - **Interpretation**: This is a typical trend where senior employees with greater experience and skills command higher salaries. It suggests that the company is rewarding experience, but it may also reflect an opportunity for more balanced compensation strategies that value skills and performance, rather than just age or tenure.

## Conclusion

This analysis provides a clear picture of ABC Company’s workforce structure and offers valuable insights into several key areas:

- **Team Composition**: The distribution of employees across teams reveals areas where the company is likely investing more resources (e.g., Team A) and areas that might need additional support (e.g., Team D).
- **Position Distribution**: The company appears to have a leadership-heavy structure, which may work well for strategic decision-making but could benefit from a stronger focus on technical or operational roles.
- **Age Demographics**: The company’s workforce is predominantly made up of mid-career professionals, indicating a stable and experienced team. However, attracting younger employees could be beneficial for fostering innovation and ensuring the company remains adaptable.
- **Salary Expenditures**: The high salary expenditures for managerial roles and Team B indicate that these areas are critical to the company's success. This data could be used to review compensation structures and ensure they align with company goals.
- **Age vs. Salary Correlation**: The positive correlation between age and salary suggests that the company is compensating experience, which aligns with industry standards, though adjustments based on performance and skills could optimize payroll efficiency.
